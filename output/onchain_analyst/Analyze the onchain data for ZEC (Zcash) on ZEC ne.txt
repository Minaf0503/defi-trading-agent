Analyze the onchain data for ZEC (Zcash) on ZEC network. Please:
1. Gather onchain data from all available sources (liquidity pools, holders, transactions, supply)
2. Analyze holder behavior and distribution patterns
3. Examine liquidity pool dynamics and concentration
4. Review transaction patterns and network activity
5. Monitor mempool for large pending transactions
6. Identify accumulation/distribution signals and whale movements
7. Provide a trading recommendation (BUY/HOLD/SELL) with:
   - Confidence level (high/medium/low)
   - Detailed rationale based on onchain metrics
   - Key onchain factors driving the recommendation
   - Risk factors based on onchain data
8. Include a summary table with key onchain metrics and signals
